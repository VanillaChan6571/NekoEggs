# NekoEggs
NekoEggs are files/eggs for Pterodactyl Panel. 

These are used to download files/import files for new users.

These files are optimized to the server hardware with some exception. (Example 1.18 is a fucking mess. or forge/fabric servers.) [We will attempt to optimize these servers when they popup.]

These Files are aimed for (1.17 Purpur) [We intrusted purpur as they aim for the same reasons.] Sure paper tries but won't actually implement good patches.

If you ever come across this you may download the "optimized" files for yourself as these are open to anyone.
